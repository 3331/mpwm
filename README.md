# mpwm - Multi Pointer Window Manager

```
apt install libx11-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libjson-c-dev
make
```

mpwm is based on [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and a
fast, small, and dynamic window manager which uses xinput2
to enable the use of multi pointer (MPX) for X.  

Currently there is no bindings for creating/managing device pairs.  

Use the tool `xinput` to manage devices for multi pointer/keyboard adventures for now.  

## Features/patches

* Intuitive (MODKEY + TAB) behaviour
  * Cycle through stack and watch windows move around (MODKEY + TAB)
  * **TODO** Combined with (ControlMask) it will cycle through tags instead of clients
  * Combining client/tag cycling bindings with (ShiftMask) will change cycle direction to back
* Proper multi cursor support with XInput2
  * Multiple cursor/keyboard pairs can have focus on 1 window
  * **TODO** Limit only 1 pointer/keyboard pair to have focus on an application at a time
  * **TODO** Cycle already existing devices to other masters
  * **TODO** Create new master device pair
  * **TODO** Remove master device pair
* Improved fullscreen support with multi monitors
  * Swap entire monitor with next/prev monitor (MODKEY|ShiftMask|ControlMask + .) or (MODKEY|ShiftMask|ControlMask + ,)
  * Move fullscreen applications to other screens with keyboard (MODKEY + .) or (MODKEY + ,)
  * Move fullscreen applications to other screens with mouse (MODKEY|ShiftMask + Button1)
  * Toggle fullscreen on window (MODKEY|ShiftMask + f)
* [centeredmaster](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/centeredmaster/) (MODKEY + o)
* [rmaster](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/rmaster/) (MODKEY + r)
* Forced focus monitor

### Forced Monitor Focus

If you have 3 monitors, you can select 1 monitor to always be the one in focus, this means that the mouse is essentially locked to be within that monitor.  

Going out of bounds of the selected monitor causes an automatic swap between the two monitors, and then another swap with a pointer warp, here is an example:

```text

`x` is the pointer

                      Forced focus
+---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+
|               |  |               |  |               |
|       1       |  |       2     x |  |       3       |
|               |  |               |  |               |
+---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+

Now the pointer moves from screen 2 to screen 3

First thing that happens is that screen 2 and 3 swap places

                      Forced focus
+---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+
|               |  |               |  |               |
|       1       |  |       3       |  | x     2       |
|               |  |               |  |               |
+---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+

Now screen 1 and 2 swap places

                      Forced focus
+---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+
|               |  |               |  |               |
|       2       |  |       3       |  | x     1       |
|               |  |               |  |               |
+---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+

Next the pointer is warped to the left side of the forced focus monitor

                      Forced focus
+---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+
|               |  |               |  |               |
|       2       |  | x     3       |  |       1       |
|               |  |               |  |               |
+---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+
```

This means that you can keep moving the mouse right or left forever, and the screens will just rotate around.

## Requirements

In order to build mpwm you need the Xlib header files.

## Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (mpwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install mpwm (if
necessary as root):

```text
make clean install
```

## Running mpwm

Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start mpwm using startx:

```text
exec mpwm
```

In order to connect mpwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

```text
DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec mpwm
```

(This will start mpwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, and enable other fancy stuff
such as hyperlinks and opacity, you can do something like this in your .xinitrc:

```text
picom &
eval "$(hsetroot -solid '#000000')"
eval "$(dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session)"
while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
do
    sleep 1
done &
exec mpwm
```

## Configuration

The configuration of mpwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
